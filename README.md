**Trading Terminal is down for now, I am working to restore it up**
# Trading-Terminal (Beta)
## About
* A Comprehensive Trading App that allows Analysts to visualize, Research, Predict and carry out algorithmic trading on either stocks/crypto
* Beware, this is not an advisory Investment app but just a base tool for investment decisions and you carry further liability when utilizing its CCXT and interactive brokerage aspect

## Updates and project goals
* Beta is up and running, Thanks to the Cloud Provision by AWS Grant for businesses that allowed me to utilize powerful EC2 instance to run the heavy Backtesting models and test out this proof of concept enabling a transition from streamlit cloud
* 80% of the code base is working : Still preparing stable pipelines for Finviz screeners, and snippets that require external API calls that have subscriptions
* I am working on the AI Multi-modial Chatbot to utilize relevant code, generate data and report in real-time how the market is doing and the most potential profit trades to do.
* On side, I am continously improving the UI/UX by livening the charts and appending sentiment analysis, alongside the bot ux 
* I decided to Re-structure the code into individual folders for readability and future updates, everything is still in the app.py and will break the repo down into individual components and start updating and continously testing
