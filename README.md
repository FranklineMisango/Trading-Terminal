# Trading-Terminal (Beta) 
## About
* A Comprehensive Trading App that allows Analysts to visualize, research, predict and carry out algorithmic trading on either stocks/crypto
* Beware, this is not an Investment app but just a base tools for investment decisions despite its CCXT and interactive brokers integrations

## Updates and project goals
* Beta is up and 80% of the quantitative algorithms are working. I am still working on the AI Trading aspect on regards of a multi-modial agent that can utilize the code and report in real-time how the market is and potential trades to do.
* I am working on bettering the UI/UX with live charts and relevant sentiment, alongside the chatbot agent who can do the analysis and report to your email on what is going on in the market regarding your stocks in certain intervals
* Re-structuring the code into individual folders, everything is still in the app.py and will break the repo down into individual components and start updating and continously testing
 
# Tech stack

* AWS
* Docker
